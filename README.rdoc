== Battleship game

This simple Rails app allows you to create BattleshipGames which have many
Battleships in them.

* Add an orientation to the battleship form
* Validate that Battleships cannot cross over each other
* Validate that Battleships cannot extend off the edge of the board
* Put a limit on the amount of Battleships a BattleshipGame can have
